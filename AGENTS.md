```markdown
**Example: Feature Implementation Flow**

Frontend Agent ‚Üí Backend Agent ‚Üí DevOps Agent

1. **Frontend Agent** designs UI components and user interaction
2. **Backend Agent** implements required APIs and data models
3. **DevOps Agent** deploys and monitors the feature
```

#### 2. Parallel Collaboration

```markdown
**Example: Performance Optimization**

Code Review Agent ‚Üê ‚Üí Frontend Agent
                 ‚Üê ‚Üí Backend Agent  
                 ‚Üê ‚Üí Desktop Agent

All agents work simultaneously on different aspects of performance optimization.
```

#### 3. Cross-Domain Consultation

```markdown
**Example: Security Implementation**

Web3 Agent ‚Üí Code Review Agent (security validation)
          ‚Üí DevOps Agent (infrastructure security)
          ‚Üí Documentation Agent (security documentation)
```

### Handoff Protocols

#### Context Sharing Format

```typescript
interface HandoffContext {
  task: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    requirements: string[];
    constraints: string[];
  };
  codebase: {
    affectedFiles: string[];
    relatedComponents: string[];
    dependencies: string[];
  };
  progress: {
    completed: string[];
    inProgress: string[];
    pending: string[];
  };
  notes: string[];
}
```

#### Example Handoff Message

```markdown
**Handoff: Frontend ‚Üí Backend**

**Task**: Implement real-time chat feature
**Requirements**: 
- Real-time message synchronization
- User authentication
- Message persistence
- Typing indicators

**Context**:

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Agent Context Confusion

**Problem**: Agent provides solutions for wrong technology stack

**Solution**:
- Review and update system prompts
- Add more specific project context
- Include technology version constraints

#### 2. Inconsistent Code Style

**Problem**: Different agents produce inconsistent code

**Solution**:
- Create shared style guidelines
- Include code formatting examples in prompts
- Use automated formatting tools (Biome, Ultracite)

#### 3. Integration Conflicts

**Problem**: Changes from different agents conflict

**Solution**:
- Implement better handoff protocols
- Use feature branches for agent work
- Require code review before merging

### Debug Checklist

- [ ] System prompt includes current project context
- [ ] Agent has access to latest documentation
- [ ] Tool integrations are working correctly
- [ ] Knowledge base is up to date
- [ ] Agent collaboration protocols are followed
- [ ] Quality standards are met
- [ ] Performance metrics are within targets

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
