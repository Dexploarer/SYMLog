## Platform Integration

### SYMLog Tech Stack Optimization

Windsurf configuration is optimized for:

- **Next.js 15** App Router patterns with Server Components
- **React 19** with latest features and concurrent rendering
- **TypeScript** strict mode with intelligent type inference

- **Turborepo** monorepo management with workspace awareness
- **Convex** reactive backend integration
- **Tauri 2** desktop application development
- **Biome + Ultracite** code quality tools integration

### Monorepo Awareness

Windsurf is configured to understand the SYMLog monorepo structure:

```
SYMLog/
├── apps/
│   ├── auth-web/          # Authentication service
│   ├── fumadocs/          # Documentation platform
│   └── web/               # Main application with Tauri
├── packages/              # Shared packages
└── .windsurf/            # IDE configuration
```

- Real-time collaboration with AI for UI tweaks
- Automatic debugging and error resolution

### 4. **Codebase Navigation**
- Intelligent code search across entire monorepo
- Contextual file suggestions based on current task
- Automatic dependency resolution and import suggestions

## Performance Optimization

### Indexing Configuration
- Optimized indexing for monorepo structure
- Selective file watching for better performance
- Cached context retrieval for faster suggestions

### Memory Management
- Efficient context loading for large codebases
- Lazy loading of workspace segments
- Optimized AI model usage for different task types

## VSCode Extension Compatibility

Windsurf maintains full VSCode extension compatibility. Recommended extensions for SYMLog development:

- **TypeScript + JavaScript**: Enhanced TypeScript support
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**: Utility class completion
- **Prettier**: Code formatting (integrated with Biome)
- **GitLens**: Git integration and history
- **Thunder Client**: API testing
- **Tauri**: Desktop development support

## Development Patterns

### Component Development
```tsx
// Windsurf will understand SYMLog component patterns
export function ComponentName({ prop }: ComponentProps) {
  // AI assistance for implementation
  return (
    // Intelligent JSX completion with Tailwind classes
  );
}
```

### API Development
```typescript
// Cascade understands Next.js App Router patterns
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // AI-assisted implementation with error handling
}
```

### Desktop Integration
```rust
// Tauri command integration with AI assistance
#[tauri::command]
fn command_name() -> Result<String, String> {
  // AI-powered Rust development
}
```

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Code Quality
- Real-time linting with Biome integration
- Ultracite code quality suggestions
- Automated code review with AI insights

### Testing
- Intelligent test generation based on implementation
- Coverage analysis with improvement suggestions
- E2E test generation for user workflows

### Documentation
- Automatic documentation generation
- Code comment suggestions with context awareness
- API documentation updates based on code changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Slow Performance**
   - Check indexing status in Windsurf status bar
   - Exclude unnecessary directories from indexing
   - Restart language server if needed

2. **Context Issues**
   - Verify workspace root is set correctly
   - Check file inclusion/exclusion patterns
   - Refresh codebase index if context seems stale

3. **AI Features Not Working**
   - Ensure proper authentication to Windsurf services
   - Check internet connectivity for AI models
   - Verify subscription status and usage limits
